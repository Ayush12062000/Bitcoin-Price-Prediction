# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
Using Neural Networks to Forecast Bitcoin Prices (LSTM)

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The problem is that we have to study the historical data of the Bitcoin and then Predict Bitcoin Prices in future.

## METHODOLOGY
Initially, install all the required necessary libraries. Next, load the CSV file containing Bitcoin’s historical price data, which I downloaded from Yahoo Finance. Then, we’ll do a little data preprocessing so that the prices we observe are the Close prices and the index is in a datetime format. Finally, in order to improve performance, we will scale the data.
Here, In this project I used a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a class of Neural Networks and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network is a type of RNN. We are using an RNN instead of a normal Neural Network such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Network because RNNs are most appropriately used for sequential data such as our Bitcoin historical price data.
